### Research Motivation
The research question is crucial because understanding the factors that drive viewer engagement can inform content creators, streaming platforms, and marketers. It can help in improving content strategies, optimizing recommendations, and enhancing user experience. Specifically, it focuses on identifying key variables (like genre, release year, cast, duration, etc.) that correlate strongly with viewer engagement metrics such as votes and ratings.
