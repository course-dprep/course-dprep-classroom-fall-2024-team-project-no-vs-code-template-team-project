# Research Question 
Is there a correlation between a movie's runtime and its IMDb rating?

# Research motivation
The relationship between a movie's runtime and its IMDb rating is intriguing because it touches on the core of audience engagement and satisfaction. In the age of streaming, where viewers have an abundance of content at their fingertips, understanding whether longer or shorter films are more favorably received can provide valuable insights into consumer behavior and preferences.

Additionally, filmmakers often face tough decisions about how long their films should be. A longer runtime allows for more detailed storytelling, character development, and complex narratives, but it may also test the audience's patience. On the other hand, shorter films might be more accessible and appealing to time-constrained viewers but could risk feeling rushed or underdeveloped.

By examining this correlation, we can gain insights into whether audiences generally prefer concise, tightly-edited films or if they appreciate the depth and nuance that longer movies can offer. This research can also reveal whether certain genres (like action, drama, or horror) benefit more from a particular runtime, informing filmmakers, producers, and distributors about optimal movie lengths for different types of films.
